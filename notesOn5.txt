Diagonal lines:
6,4 -> 2,0

diagonal lines can be inputed from 4 ways:
- bottom left, upper right /
- bottom right, upper left \
- upper right, bottom left /
- upper left, bottom right \

if I force read from left for the starting point, how do I check 
for diagonality?

- iterate from left, adding one to left and either adding one to y for 
larger point or detracting one from y

There's a better way to do this

(2, 0) - (6, 4) = (-4, -4)
(6, 4) - (2, 0) = (4, 4)
if x1 - x2 = y1 - y2 I think? 
missing (8, 0) - (0, 8)
(8, 0) - (0, 8) = (8, -8)
